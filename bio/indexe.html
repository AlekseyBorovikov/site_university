					<h2>Personal development</h2>

					<p>&emsp;I am Alexey Borovikov Ivanovich, I was born on a snowy spring day on March 14, 2000 in the city of Makeyevka, Donetsk region. I grew up in a family of miners in the village of Nizhnyaya Krynka at the Yasinovataya Glubokaya mine. I may be the only child in the family, but my family is big and friendly, I have 4 cousins and we get along well.</p>
					<p>&emsp;My parents had a great influence on the formation of my personality. From the earliest years I was a well-rounded child. I liked to learn and learn new things. To make it easier for me to get to know myself, my parents took me to different sections, for example, children's dances, karate and sports ballroom dancing.</p>
					<p>&emsp;No less important for my parents was my development, which they were seriously engaged in. For example, we bought educational toys, favorite, from such games, I had a designer. The designer develops fine motor skills well, influences motor and speech zones in the cerebral cortex. Even before kindergarten I was taught to count and read, and in kindergarten I could already solve easy equations and write. Therefore, I went to school as a six-year-old already prepared.</p>
					<p>&emsp;My school was school No. 102. Since I lived in a small village, we had only two schools, so there was practically nothing to choose from, but, in the end, I am glad that I studied at this school. There were decent teachers who gave me a lot of new knowledge and then I made friends with whom I communicate to this day. Throughout my studies at school, from 1st to 11th grade, my favorite subject was mathematics, this is what I learned with pleasure. But I maintained good academic performance equally in all disciplines and tried to participate in all competitions. At the same time, I did not forget to attend classes at the dance school, which is why I often participated in school events.</p>
					<p>&emsp;For a long time I could not decide where to go to study after school. I understood exactly that I like mathematics and I want to associate my profession with it. Going through different options, just before the final exams I decided to go to study as a programmer. And I still don't regret my choice. DonNTU was the only university that provided a huge selection of different areas in programming, so I decided to enroll here.</p>
					<p>&emsp;Here I gained basic knowledge in many areas of programming. I have studied the basics of most popular programming languages, the principles of building application architecture, client-server interaction, the structure of operating systems and protocols, approaches to training neural networks and much more.</p>
					<p>&emsp;During my studies at the university, in addition to learning programming, I did not forget about sports and enjoyed going to the arena to run. The university gave me the opportunity to study in winter. Classes with a coach allowed me to achieve good results in athletics.</p>

					<h2>Professional development</h2>

					<p>&emsp;My professional development began by the end of my bachelor's degree, when I had enough knowledge and could apply it in practice. At that time, I already knew programming languages such as java, c++, python, kotlin, php, c#, of which I most often wrote in java, kotlin, c++. By the end of my bachelor's degree, I definitely decided that I wanted to work as an android developer and in the fourth year I got a job at a small startup. This job gave me a boost, I gained confidence in it. My tasks included writing a bot in the python programming language, this bot was conceived to be multifunctional, but could show the weather, help find restaurant menus and much more. Then he successfully defended his diploma, passed the exams for admission to the magistracy and changed jobs. The decision to change jobs was not easy, because I am used to people with whom I have worked for a long time.</p>

					<p>&emsp;I was immediately accepted into the team in a new place. At this job, I wrote java/kotlin applications for android using the internal api. Combining training and work was not easy, but the main thing is experience, and I appreciate it. During this time, I received support from my parents and friends, for which I thank them. Thanks to this support, and of course my efforts, I not only moved up the career ladder, but also at the end of the 5th year I got an increased scholarship.</p>

					<p>&emsp;Now I am writing several applications simultaneously for android and android TV. I am grateful to all my teachers at my university, because each of them has made a contribution to my professional development, my knowledge and the way I am now, it is definitely their merit.</p>

					<h2>Goals, plans and vision of the future</h2>

					<p>&emsp;In the near future I want to learn English, I already have A2, but I would like to raise my skills to the level of B2-C1. This will open up even more opportunities for me. And, probably, the main goal is to graduate successfully from the university and defend a diploma. And finally, he will get a job where he could practice English with native speakers.</p>
